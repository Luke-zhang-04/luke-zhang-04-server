## Compared to Other Bots

[The Carleton University Debate Society NotTDBot](https://github.com/spiltbeans/NotTDBot) is the most commonly used bot in debate tournaments, but it's some features.

1. **Live Speech Timer** - a progress bar and current time is displayed and continuously changed, so you don't have to speculate time. Unlike the NotTDBot, this bot can reliabily time you and can replace your phone.
2. **Configurable** - host the bot yourself and configure it to your liking with YAML
3. **User Friendly** - created with ease of use in mind
   1. Simple autocorrect (e.g `hekp` -> `help`, `star` -> `start`)
   2. Syntax is straighforward (e.g `!start 5` instead of `+start {5}`)
4. **Other Functions** - features such as random motions, team generation, and some other useful debate commands are included.
