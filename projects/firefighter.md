# Firefighter Bot

To make the bot, we assembled parts, designed PCBs, soldered components, and debugged circuits using multimeters. Then we programmed a PIC chip using BASIC to navigate a maze to blow out a candle. We were the only ones in our class to complete the maze by the end of the term. You can find a video of maze 2, room 4 here: [https://youtu.be/kA35vJTtDxw](https://youtu.be/kA35vJTtDxw).
