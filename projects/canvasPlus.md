An improved Canvas widget for tkinter with more functionality to display graphical elements like lines or text.

Tkinter's Canvas widget has some limitations which are adressed in this package.

Simillar to the default tkinter Canvas widget, e.g `canvas.create_rectangle`, other canvas objects can be created.
